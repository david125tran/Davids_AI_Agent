# Davids_AI_Agent
  
This script is designed to interact with the OpenAI API to assist in modifying a Python script.
It reads a specified Python file, generates a prompt based on its content and a user message,
and sends this prompt to the OpenAI API. The assistant's response is then saved to a new Python file.

API Integration
- The script uses the OpenAI API to generate responses based on a system prompt and user message.
- It requires the `python-dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file, specifically for the OpenAI API key.
- The OpenAI API key is loaded from a `.env` file, allowing for secure storage of sensitive information.
- The script uses the `openai` library to interact with the OpenAI API, specifically the chat completion endpoint.

Natural Language Processing
- The script constructs a user prompt that includes the content of a specified Python file and a custom message.
- It sends this prompt to the OpenAI API, which generates a response based on the provided context.
- The assistant's response is expected to be a valid Python script, which is then saved to a specified output file.
